        <h1>Star Wars</h1>
        <p>Star wars, a space opera storytelling universe. Created by George lucas
            Begun in the 1970s and '80s and continued in the 21st century.
        This movie series plot consists almost entirely of walking the path
    of light and dark. Love and sacrifice, also the blurred line between what is right
     and what is wrong</p>

     <h3>Weapons and Abilities</h3>
     <p>There are many weapons and abilities in the Stars Wars Universe,
        so I will just go over the most used. The chosen weapons for stormtroopers
        are blasters. Most simple way of picturing the gun is thinking of guns
        that shoots out lasers. The weapon of choice for the Jedi/Sith were lightsabers.
        They are also know as laser swords. The Sith/Jedi had special abilities, some better than others,
        and it was called the Force. The Force in the Star Wars universe is the energy of life itself.
        The Jedi/Sith could harness this energy and move objects,trick weak minds, seeing the future,
        and much more.</p>
